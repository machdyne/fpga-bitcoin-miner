# ICEStick FPGA LED example project

Example project for Lattice icestick FPGA board. Does nothing but turn on all the LED's.

Source for this is https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio-examples.

Built with apio (https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio).

Build with `apio build`, run simulation with `apio sim`, upload with `apio upload`. Very simple.
